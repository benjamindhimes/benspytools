This tool will convert a csv with three columns into a PNG image.
Note that this tool is built in **Python 3**.
To use it, first install the requirements in `requirements.txt` by using
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
If this fails, you may need to run the command with `sudo` permissions.
After this library is installed, run the command `python3 bar_chart_from_csv.py` out of the file's pwd, 
and follow the instructions in the prompts. If done correctly, an image should be created and displayed with the data
in bar chart format. A csv of the sample data is provided in this folder as well.
